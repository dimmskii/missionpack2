export PNG as is WITH ARTBOARD (otherwise illustrator crops to very edges of vector stuff)
illustrator will give out something like nailgun128-01.png

ICONW:
Scale PNG to 120x120px, then from the center resize the CANVAS back to 128x128 -- that is iconw

ICONA:
Scale PNG to 88x88px, then from the center resize the CANVAS back to 128x128
draw a 4px non-antialiased square border around it same exact color as icon -- that is its respective icona (at least according to what bfg had from missionpackplus assets)
some icona's (with exception of railgun being an edge-to-edge type deal) still need this done since they are too big or the same size as their iconw
