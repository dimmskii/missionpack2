# missionpack2 - Quake 3 Ultimate Arena
 Merged code from Kr3m's missionpack plus features together with my additional things like Arena/Team Arena gamemodes, green armor and HMG from QL

## To do
- Finish coding Arena/Team Arena gametype logic
- Proper HMG fire rate (I can't easily find the nextFire code like in Q2)
- Cvar to disable nailgun bounce
- Finish getting rid of clans system from TA -- g_redTeam and g_blueTeam, ui logos, etc
- Anything else? Let me know in the comments below :)

 - **Kevin "79DieselRabbit" Worrel** for Frozen Colors map (named as mp2team1 -- we needed at least one amazing custom map supporting 1FCTF, etc)
 - **Hubster** for his famous Aerowalk conversion (named as mp2tourney1 -- green armor!)
 - **Dmitri "Dimmskii" Poterianski** (myself) for UI work and upscales, QL model conversions, coding, anything else I forgot to mention
